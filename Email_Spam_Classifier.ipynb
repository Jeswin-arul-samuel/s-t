    " \n",
    "Yeah, right.\n",
    " \n",
    "Fast forward to today, and I've trained thousands of students to become ethical hackersâ€”and many of them had zero prior experience. Some even landed high-paying jobs right after completing my course!\n",

    "So, what's the secret?\n",
    " \n",
    "Simple. You just need the right roadmap.\n",
    " \n",

    "And here's the kickerâ€¦\n",
    " \n",
    "Today I have launched Nav Varsha Special 0ffer.\n",
